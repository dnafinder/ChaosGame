# ChaosGame
ChaosGame brings the classic chaos game to any regular N-gon (N≥5) with an automatic “optimal/kissing” ratio, exclusion rules (no-repeat, no-adjacent, custom offsets or callbacks), and a reel-like animation where each diagonal flashes, the point lands, and the line vanishes—revealing striking polygonal fractals.
